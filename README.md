## 1. Introduction

In this project, I'm building a robot and using an FPGA for some of the processing. My reasons are threefold:
1. Learn how to use FPGAs, especially in robotics
2. Learn what aspects of robotics FPGAs excel at, and learn how to incorporate an FPGA into an actual robot.
3. Learn more about embedded programming for robotics.
